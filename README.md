 Plantix Nigeria - Your Crop Doctor

 What It Does

Plantix Nigeria is a mobile app that helps Nigerian farmers diagnose crop diseases using their smartphone camera and voice. Farmers can speak in their local language (Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, or English), take a photo of a sick plant, and instantly get a diagnosis with treatment recommendations, even without internet connection.

Think of it as a "crop doctor in your pocket" that speaks your language and works anywhere, anytime.

 Why It Matters

Nigerian farmers lose **5-40% of their crops** every year to pests and diseases. A single misdiagnosed infection can destroy an entire harvest and a family's livelihood.

The Problem:
- Professional agronomists are expensive and hard to reach in rural areas
- Existing farming apps don't support Nigerian languages
- Most solutions require constant internet access (which many rural farmers don't have)
- Low literacy rates make text-heavy apps difficult to use

Our Solution:
Plantix Nigeria puts expert crop diagnosis in every farmer's hands, speaking their language and working offline.

 Who It's For

Primary Users:
- Small-scale Nigerian farmers
- Rural farmers with limited internet access
- Farmers who prefer speaking over reading
- Agricultural cooperatives and extension workers
