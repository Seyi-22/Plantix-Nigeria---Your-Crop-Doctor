# Plantix Nigeria - Your Crop Doctor 🌱

## What It Does

Plantix Nigeria is a mobile app that helps Nigerian farmers diagnose crop diseases using their smartphone camera and voice. Farmers can speak in their local language (Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, or English), take a photo of a sick plant, and instantly get a diagnosis with treatment recommendations, even without internet connection.

Think of it as a "crop doctor in your pocket" that speaks your language and works anywhere, anytime.

## Why It Matters

Nigerian farmers lose **5-40% of their crops** every year to pests and diseases. A single misdiagnosed infection can destroy an entire harvest and a family's livelihood.

**The Problem:**
- Professional agronomists are expensive and hard to reach in rural areas
- Existing farming apps don't support Nigerian languages
- Most solutions require constant internet access (which many rural farmers don't have)
- Low literacy rates make text-heavy apps difficult to use

**Our Solution:**
Plantix Nigeria puts expert crop diagnosis in every farmer's hands, speaking their language and working offline.

## Who It's For

**Primary Users:**
- Small-scale Nigerian farmers
- Rural farmers with limited internet access
- Farmers who prefer speaking over reading
- Agricultural cooperatives and extension workers

**Perfect for farmers growing:**
Tomatoes, Maize, Cassava, Rice, Yam, Beans, Pepper, Okra, Plantain, and Sorghum


## Key Features

**Voice-First Interface**
Navigate the entire app using voice commands in English, Yoruba, Igbo, or Hausa. Just say "Kini problem tomato mi" (What's wrong with my tomato) and the app guides you through the diagnosis.

 **Offline Diagnosis**
Works without internet! The app has built-in AI that can identify 50+ common crop diseases across 10 major Nigerian crops - all stored on your phone.

**Local Agro-Dealer Network**
Get instant treatment recommendations with prices and locations of nearby dealers. For example: "Apply Ridomil fungicide available at Balogun Ventures (3.2 km away) for ₦850."

**Disease Outbreak Alerts**
When multiple farmers in your area report the same disease, you'll get an alert to check your crops early - preventing the spread before it reaches you.

**Free Forever**
Core disease diagnosis is completely free. Optional premium features (₦500/month) include video calls with agronomists and soil testing.

How It Works - Real User Story
